## Growth Mindset

For someone who tries to be a perfectionist, growth mindset is something that can be difficult to "be in" for me. Growth mindset is an acceptance of being okay with failure and accepting challenges that may require more than 1, 2, or more attempts at accomplishing.  Also being in a growth mindset means asking for help which is also a difficulty as I am use to finding the solution to a problem by myself. Three reminders of how to keep myself in a growth mindset are:

- Everyone learns at different rates. I need to be okay with failing and that failing means I am learning. I need to tell myself at the beginning of each day, "I will fail and that is okay."
- This isn't a race. I can be competitive and Code Fellows is not about being the best, it is about learning.
- Always take a breath. Getting to a place of being "stuck" means I need to take a step back, breathe, and try again. Being in a positive mindset means that taking multiple opportunities to find a solution.
