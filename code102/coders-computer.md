## Text Editors

#### First what is a text editor?
There are a ton of text editors available for coders or aspiring coders like ourselves to choose from. 
> A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

#### What makes one text editor better than another?
For the most part it can really depend on the coder and what features they need the editor to possess for the coding .  I can see it where in certain environment such as schools with a focus on software engineering, or companies that produce software, may require students or employees to have a specific text editor.
