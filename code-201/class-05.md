### What Is A Real World Use Case For The `alt` Attribute Being Used In A Website

Having a visually impaired user working with a screeen reader which automatically reads the content will also read the `alt` text to give the user an understanding of what the image is.

### How Can You Improve Accessibility Of Images In An HTML Document

The key is to deliver a usable experience for all users which include those impaired visually. The `alt` text attribute for `img` elements is the key in improving accessibility. When an image provides critical information to the user, the same information must be condensed but included in the `alt` attribute for the screen reader to read.

### What Image Type Would You Use To Display A Screenshot On Your Website And Why
