### An Acrostic HTML & Parsing Poem

- **C**alling for a web page requires two parties
- **O**ne is the client
- **D**uring the time a request is being sent by the client a server awaits
- **E**ach has their distinct role

- **F**ollowing the request a response is served
- **E**ach HTML response is parsed by the client's browser
- **L**onely, the parser encounters a reference to a script file
- **L**oopy, the parser stops parsing & requests the script file.
- **O**rdering the script from the server, the parser executes.
- **W**hile the client's browser finishes reading the HTML
- **S**ampling the full response, a web page is born

### Describe How HTML, CSS, and JS files Are “Parsed”

Parsing is a very critical step from having a webpage on a server to seeing the page on the user's screen. A client's browser must have the HTML data and links to external CSS & JS files. The intial step for parsing is building the page based on the DOM (Document Object Model) & utilizing tokens. The tokens can assign specific pieces that represent pieces of the DOM and to be requested from the server. It is important for developers to understand this process as it greatly impacts latency & how the client's machine is single threaded. Bottom line a user wants their page quickly and design of a webpage can impact how a browser parses the HTML, CSS, & JS data.

### How To find Images To Add To A Website

The issue is never about finding an image that looks good. The issue for me as a developer is to ensure that an image is not copyrighted. The easiest way is to utilize Google's image search feature and in options use the "Creative Commons licenses" selection to ensure the image is available for usage.

### "String" vs A Number

Visualizing a string versus a number in javascript is all about '' or "". For example:

    - 24
    - "24"
The first 24 is the number, while "24" is the string.
