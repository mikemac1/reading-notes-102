### Describe The CSS Properties Of `margin` And `padding` As Characters In A Story. What Is Their Role In A Story Titled: “The Box Model”

**The Box Model** by *Mike McCarty*

`margin` and `padding` were buddies. They loved the same things and were always excited about seeing `content`, the coolest dude on the page.  However there is a bully in the neighborhood and his name is `border`. Whenever `margin` or `padding` approach each other, `border` was always getting bigger with his pixels creating separation between the two.  Until one day, a superhero named developer came walking by and placed a none in the `border`. `margin` and `padding` were forever grateful and placed their `background-color` to #ff1a1a so everyone can see their excitement. The end!

![Code to answer](arrayex.PNG)

Yes the `people` array is an array with three nested arrays. Yes the values can be accessed utilizing the values index. For instance if I wanted to access the value `accountant`. I would do so by using `people[1][2]`. This indicates the first number 1 shows `accountant` resides in the 2nd array indexed by 1 as arrays start counting at 0 and is in the 3rd listed place which is indexed by the number 2.

### List Five Shorthand Operators For Assignment In JavaScript And Describe What They Do

`X += 1`: is saying x = x + 1 so the variable is incrementing by adding 1 to itself.

`x -= 1`: is saying x = x - 1 so the variable is decrementing by subtracting 1 to itself.

`X *= 2`: is saying x = x x 2 so the variable is increasing by multiplying 2 to itself.

`X /= 2`: is saying x = x / 2 so the variable is decreasing by dividing 2 to itself.

`X **= 2`: is saying x = x ^ 2 so the variable is increasing by taking the exponent of 2 to itself.

### Read The Code Below And Evaluate The Last Expression And Explain What The Result Would Be And Why

![Code to answer](codeex.PNG)

### Describe A Real World Example Of When A Conditional Statement Should Be Used In A JavaScript Program

The immediate example that comes to mind is an electronic thermostat for an air conditioner. When the temperature reaches a setpoint, say 80 degrees, the air conditioner turns on.

### Give An Example Of When A Loop Is Useful In JavaScript
