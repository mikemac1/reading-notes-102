The idea behind this is to practice using the markdown syntax to enable tracking of ideas during Code Fellows' lectures.  Practicing this now will enable me to be a better software engineer. The syntax is using a system called Markdown. Here are some formatting rules to remember.

## Headings

   > # Highest
   >
   > ## Second Highest
   >
   > ### Third Highest
   >
   > #### Fourth Highest
   >
   > ##### Fifth Highest
   >
   > ###### Sixth Highest

## Adding Emphasis

   > Making something **bold** shows emphasis.
   >
   > Another way of showing emphasis is also *italicizing* text.
   >
   > To show ***extra*** emphasis on text is using three asterisks to make text bold & italicized.

The examples above were selected based on the Markdown spec.  The examples above and a more complete list of Markdown's syntax rules visit [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#overview)
