# Operators and Loops

## Operators

All complex expressions are joined by operators, such as `=` and `+`.

**Comparison Operators**: A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.

`Operator` - Description  
`==` - Equal. Returns true if the operands are equal.

`===` - Strict equal. Returns true if the operands are equal and of the same type.

`!=` - Not equal. Returns true if the operands are not equal.

`!==` - Strict equal. Returns true if the operands are of the same type but not equal, or are of different type.

`>` - Greater than. Returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand.

`<` - Less than. Returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand.

`>=` - Greater than or eaqual to. Returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.

`<=` - Less than or equal to. Returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.

**Assignment Operators**: provides the assignment operators to assign values to variables with less key strokes.

`Operator` - Description  
`=` - Assigns right operand value to the left operand.
    `x = f()`

`+=` - Sums up left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.
    `x = x + f()`

`-=` - Subtract right operand value from the left operand value and assigns the result to the left operand.
    `x = x - f()`

`*=` - Multiply left and right operand values and assigns the result to the left operand.
    `x = x * f()`

`/=` - Divide left operand value by right operand value and assign the result to the left operand.
    `x = x / f()`

`%=` - Get the modulus of left operand divide by right operand and assign resulted modulus to the left operand.
    `x = x % f()`

`x **= f()` - The exponentiation assignment operator raises the value of a variable to the power of the right operand.
    `x = x ** f()`
